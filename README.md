# MetroGo
This is my project which i made in  4th semester of my college for my subject Algorithms And Problem Solving.
It is the simple implementation of different algorithms i learned.
Some of algorithms used are - 

Dijkstra's algorithm (to find shortest route between two stations)
Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm (Algorithm for pattern searching)
Backtracking (similar as travelling salesman problem)
And basic BFS and DFS tachniques

Some of Data Structures Used - 
vectors,maps,graphs,sets,stack,etc.
